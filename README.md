# MRI-Image-Recovery
This project solves an imputation problem where we created a neural network that learns how to recover missing portions of an image.

# üß† MRI Image Recovery: Deep Learning Assessment

## Project Overview
This repository contains my solution to an assessment focused on designing a neural network for recovering missing portions of MRI images. The primary goal is to train an architecture that can reconstruct corrupted brain images, a problem relevant in medical imaging where scans are often incomplete to save time or reduce patient exposure.

## üìÑ Problem Statement
The dataset provided includes:
- **Corrupted Images**: Stored in `test_set.npy`, containing 100 images with missing information.
- **Generated Images**: Created using a generative model for training purposes.

The objective is to:
1. Use the generative model to create a synthetic dataset for training.
2. Develop a neural network capable of recovering missing portions of the corrupted images.

## üìã Objectives

### Part 1: Dataset Creation
- **Generate Synthetic Images**:
  - Use the provided generative model to create realistic MRI images for training.
  - Save the generated dataset for reuse.
- **Visualize Data**:
  - Display 10 synthetic images and 10 corrupted images from the test set.

### Part 2: Data Preparation
- **Training Dataset**:
  - Create a `PyTorch TensorDataset` with paired corrupted and uncorrupted images.
  - Use a `DataLoader` to provide batches of data for training.
- **Test Dataset**:
  - Create a `PyTorch TensorDataset` with corrupted images only (no labels).
  - Use a `DataLoader` to prepare the test data.
- **Visualize Data**:
  - Display 10 training and 10 test images, along with corresponding labels where applicable.

### Part 3: Neural Network Design and Training
- **Model Architecture**:
  - Design a neural network architecture to recover missing image lines.
  - Train the network using the dataset created in Part 2. Pre-trained models are not allowed.
  - Display 10 images from the test set with the recovered lines filled in.
- **Save Reconstructed Images**:
  - Save the reconstructed test images into a numpy file, `test_set_nogaps.npy`. Ensure the images are in the same order and size (64x64 pixels) as in the original `test_set.npy` file.
